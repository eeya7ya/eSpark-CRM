 * id keep working, while pushing viewing into the CRM:
 *
 *   • /quotation             → redirect to the CRM hub (the old list is gone)
 *   • /quotation?tab=trash    → redirect to the CRM trash
 *   • /quotation?id=<n>       → resolve the quotation's project/company home and
 *                               forward into the CRM viewer.
 *
 * Quotations with no project (NULL project_id) have no nested CRM home — the
 * CRM viewer is mounted under a project — so they fall back to the standalone
 * read-only viewer rendered here. That fallback is the only surface left that
 * can display a project-less quotation; everything else flows through the CRM.
