 * Auto REF for a brand-new active quotation.

 * Format: <DEPT>-FO<YY>-<HEX4>   e.g. ITD1-FO26-0001
 *   DEPT  — the author's admin-assigned department code (per user); "GEN"
 *           when the user has no code yet.
 *   FO    — literal, fixed.
 *   YY    — last two digits of the current year.
 *   HEX4  — incremental counter in uppercase hexadecimal, zero-padded to 4
 *           digits. Scoped PER DEPARTMENT and PER YEAR (both live in the
 *           prefix), so it restarts at 0001 each year for each department.
 *           Picks the lowest positive integer no live active quotation holds;
 *           counters held only by soft-deleted (trashed) rows are freed for
 *           reuse, so a deleted quotation's number is recycled.
 *
 * Drafts and reviews never mint a new counter; they inherit the parent's and
 * append `.D<m>` / `.R<m>` suffixes via {@link genSuffixedRef}. References are
 * minted for quotations only — leads have their own lifecycle and no REF.
