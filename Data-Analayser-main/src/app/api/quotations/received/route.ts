/**
 * GET /api/quotations/received
 *
 * The salesperson's inbox. Lists the quotations presales handed to them via
 * "Send to sales" (quotations.sent_to_sales_to = me) — the receiving side of
 * the handoff that previously surfaced nowhere. Admins see every received
 * quotation. Each row carries who sent it and whether the salesperson has
 * already filed it (`filed` = sales_accepted_at set) into a company / client /
 * project, so the queue can separate "to file" from "filed".
 *
 * Drafts / revisions (`status` = 'draft' | 'review', `parent_ref` pointing at
 * the quotation they branched from) arrive here exactly like the original —
 * presales can hand any version of a quotation number over. Both columns are
 * returned so the queue can badge a row as "Revision of QA42226MT5" instead of
 * looking like a second, unrelated deal.
