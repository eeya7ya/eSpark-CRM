/**
 * Executive-manager confirmation workflow.
 *
 * Presales / presales managers SUBMIT a finished quotation (with pricing) or a
 * pricing sheet for sign-off; the executive manager CONFIRMS or REJECTS it.
 *
 *   GET  → the executive queue: pending + recently decided quotations and
 *          pricing sheets across every user. Executive manager / admin only.
 *   POST { type:'quotation'|'pricing', id, action:'submit'|'confirm'|'reject',
 *          reason? }
 *          - submit  → presales / presales_manager / admin (owner, or a
 *                      presales_manager / admin for any team item)
 *          - confirm / reject → executive_manager / admin
 *
 * The status ('none' → 'pending' → 'confirmed' | 'rejected') is a sign-off
 * record; it does not block the existing send-to-sales pipeline.
 *
 * Note: no UI submits a QUOTATION any more — sign-off happens on the pricing
 * sheet, upstream of the quotation, so the button on the quotation duplicated
 * it and was removed. `type:'quotation'` stays supported here (and in the
 * queue) so quotations submitted while that flow was live can still be
 * confirmed or rejected.
