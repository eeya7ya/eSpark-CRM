 * Project file metadata. The actual binary lives in Cloudflare R2;
 * this table only stores the bucket-relative `storage_path` (the R2 key is
 * `project-files/<storage_path>`).
 *
 * Two-phase upload flow used by the browser:
 *
 *   1. POST /api/project-files/sign-upload  →  presigned URL
 *      The browser sends { project_id, kind, filename, mime, size }.
 *      We validate the project, check size caps, mint a path under
 *      `<owner>/<project>/<random>-<safe-name>` and return a presigned
 *      R2 PUT URL.
 *
 *   2. PUT <signedUrl>  (browser → R2)
 *      The binary goes directly to Cloudflare R2; nothing transits
 *      this Next.js server (that's the whole point — Vercel body-size
 *      caps wouldn't allow it).
 *
 *   3. POST /api/project-files                →  register
 *      Once the PUT succeeds, the browser registers the file with us
 *      so the Files panel can list / download / delete it later.
 *
 * The split keeps secrets (service-role key) on the server while the
 * heavy bytes flow direct, and lets us authoritatively enforce
 * project-ownership and size caps before issuing the signed URL.
