 *   • "alarm"   — derived signals (pending approvals, unattached /
 *                 unclassified folders, stock checks).
 *   • "message" — admin announcements (news_posts), audience-filtered.
 *
 * Per-user state lives in `notification_state`: items the user removed
 * are filtered out; items marked read come back with `read: true` so the
 * UI can dim them. `id` doubles as the stable `notif_key` used by the
