/**
 * Phase 2 — AI pipeline briefing. ONE Groq call (not one per deal) over a
 * compact snapshot of the live, non-terminal deals returns a short prioritised
 * "what to focus on today" for the signed-in salesperson. The deterministic
 * stage + next-best-action signals from `@/lib/pipeline` are fed in as grounding
 * so the model reasons over real data rather than inventing it.
 *
 * Sales-only, same gate as the board: admin never reaches it; every sales
 * user — manager included — briefs on their OWN deals, and only the read-only
 * `viewer` role briefs across the whole tenant.
