/**
 * GET /api/admin/db-backup
 *
 * THE database backup. One click downloads a complete, restore-ready snapshot
 * of every table in the database as a single ZIP:
 *
 *   manifest.json        table order, columns, primary keys, content hashes
 *   data/<table>.json    every row in that table (lossless JSON)
 *   all.json             { <table>: rows[] } convenience roll-up
 *   README.txt           what's inside and how to restore
 *
 * This captures the DATA — clients, projects, quotations, leads, pricing,
 * users, settings. The uploaded file blobs are NOT here; those are the
 * separate "Files backup". Feed this ZIP back through Admin → Backups →
 * "Restore from backup" to re-import it into any database (it upserts every
 * row by primary key and never deletes).
 *
 * Read-only — no row or schema state is mutated. Admin only.
