/**
 * Postgres client for Vercel serverless runtimes.
 *
 * The connection URL should point at a **transaction pooler** (e.g. port
 * `6543`) — e.g.:
 *
 *   postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:6543/<database>
 *
 * Transaction mode is required for serverless because each function
 * invocation briefly checks out a pooled connection. This mode does NOT
 * support server-side prepared statements, so `prepare: false` is mandatory.
 *
 * Env var resolution order (first non-empty wins):
 *   1. DATABASE_URL            — manual setup (our docs).
 *   2. POSTGRES_URL            — common alias (also injected by some Vercel
 *                                Postgres integrations); pooled endpoint.
 *   3. POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL     — same source, Prisma-flavoured pooled URL.
 *   4. POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING — last-resort direct connection (NOT
 *                                 recommended for serverless — see note).
 *
 * The client is memoised on the module scope so hot-invoked lambdas reuse
 * the same socket between requests, and `max: 1` keeps the Vercel function's
 * pool footprint tiny.

/**
 * Seed the release-notes changelog (src/lib/releaseNotes.ts) into `news_posts`
 * so the Product-updates feed always reflects the shipped version.
 *
 * Runs once per process AFTER the schema bootstrap (so `news_posts` exists) on
 * BOTH backends, and crucially OUTSIDE their "all migrations applied — nothing
 * to do" early returns, so the changelog still seeds on warm/already-
 * bootstrapped databases. It is NOT gated by a migration flag and is idempotent
 * by title, so adding a note in releaseNotes.ts surfaces it on the next cold
 * start with no fingerprint bump. `created_by` is null (a system post) and the
 * `all` audience makes it visible to every role.
 *
 * The existence check is a separate SELECT rather than an `insert … select …
 * where not exists`, because that shape leans on Postgres' FROM-less SELECT and
 * doesn't survive the D1 translator. Two statements per *missing* note; already
 * seeded notes cost one SELECT each.
