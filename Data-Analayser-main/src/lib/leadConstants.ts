 * 1.4A — presales shared queue. A lead is pure information intake: sales
 * opens it, and it lands in a single shared presales queue. Any presales
 * person CLAIMS a lead to start working it — there is no manager hand-off /
 * distribution step. While claimed, the lead shows who is working on it.
 *
 *   new          — unclaimed, sitting in the shared presales queue.
 *   in_progress  — a presales person claimed it (assigned_to_id) and is
 *                  turning it into a company / client / project.
 *
 * The actual quotation / project work continues in the CRM client area; the
 * lead just records who owns the intake.
