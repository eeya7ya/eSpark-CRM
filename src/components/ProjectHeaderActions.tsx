/**
 * Project-level action buttons (Request for Quotation) for the project
 * drill-down header. These are PROJECT actions, so they belong on the
 * project's own pages (the quotations list, POs, BOQs) — NOT inside a single
 * quotation's viewer. When the active route is a specific quotation
 * (`.../quotations/<id>`) this renders nothing, keeping the quotation view
 * focused on the document. RFQ itself is additionally sales-only (see
 * RequestQuotationButton).
 *
 * The legacy "Request stock" button was removed in V1.5A along with the flat
 * inventory model; project-linked stock movements move to the new
 * event-sourced stock module (docs/storage-module-v1.5A.md).
