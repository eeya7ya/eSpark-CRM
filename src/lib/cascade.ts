/**
 * Cascade soft-delete / restore helpers.
 *
 * A client folder (and a company that owns folders) sits at the top of a
 * tree: folder → projects → {quotations, purchase orders, project files}.
 * These helpers stamp the whole subtree with the SAME `deleted_at`
 * timestamp as the parent, so:
 *   - the lists (which all filter `deleted_at is null`) immediately stop
 *     showing orphaned children, and
 *   - a restore can re-light exactly the rows that went down together
 *     (matched on a ±2s window around the parent's timestamp) without
 *     resurrecting rows that were independently trashed earlier.
 *
 * Every statement guards on `deleted_at is null` so re-running is safe and
 * a child trashed on its own keeps its original timestamp.
 *
 * LEADS ARE THE EXCEPTION. A presales lead is a durable work item that
 * lives in the shared presales queue on its OWN lifecycle (claim → work →
 * complete / junk). It is not "owned" by the sales-side client/project it
 * was opened against, so a sales user removing that project, client, or
 * company must NOT yank the lead out from under presales — the old cascade
 * that soft-deleted leads here was a destructive "dead link". Instead we
 * DETACH: the lead stays live in the queue and we null only the references
 * that just went away, so it carries accurate (empty), not dangling, links
 * and presales can re-file it under a live tree.
