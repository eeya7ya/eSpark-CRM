/**
 * GET /api/catalogue/export
 *
 * Dumps the entire `products` table as a plain JSON array. The client
 * (`CatalogueExportButton` in the Catalogue page) turns the rows into a
 * `.xlsx` workbook with the same column layout that
 * `/api/catalogue/upload` accepts, so the round-trip
 *
 *   download → edit in Excel → upload
 *
 * is lossless: a re-uploaded file upserts each row by `model` and updates
 * the existing record in place.
 *
 * Restricted to the people who may modify the catalogue (admins,
 * `catalogue.editor` grant holders, storage-module users) — the download
 * exposes full supplier pricing, which isn't intended for regular users, and
 * the export is one half of the round-trip they own.
