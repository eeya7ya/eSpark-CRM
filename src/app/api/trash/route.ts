 * POST → restores a trashed folder, quotation, or company by clearing
 *        `deleted_at`. For folders the restore can optionally cascade to
 *        the quotations that were trashed together with the folder
 *        (detected by matching their `deleted_at` to the folder's within
 *        a small window — folders soft-delete their children in the same

 * straight from an active list without passing through the Trash.
 *
 * Referential integrity is handled by the schema's FK delete rules:
 *   • companies            → folders/quotations/contacts get company_id SET NULL
 *   • client_folders       → projects CASCADE (and their files/assignments/
 *                            reports), quotations get folder_id SET NULL — so
 *                            we explicitly purge the folder's quotations too.
 *   • quotations           → change_requests / stock_checks CASCADE
